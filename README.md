## The 4 Agents

### 1. IncumbentsAgent
- **Purpose**: Competitive landscape analysis
- **Focus**: Existing competitors, features, market positioning, strengths/weaknesses
- **Output**: Detailed competitor analysis with actionable insights

### 2. FundingAgent 
- **Purpose**: Investment and funding research
- **Focus**: Recent funding rounds, investor sentiment, valuation trends, VC attractiveness
- **Output**: Funding landscape analysis with investor perspective

### 3. GrowthAgent
- **Purpose**: Market growth and revenue analysis  
- **Focus**: Market size, growth rates, revenue potential, economic factors
- **Output**: Quantitative growth assessment with market dynamics

### 4. DecisionAgent
- **Purpose**: Synthesis and final recommendation
- **Focus**: Combines all research to make investment recommendation
- **Output**: Final decision (Good/Neutral/Poor) with detailed reasoning

## Built-in Evaluation System

The system includes comprehensive evaluation across multiple criteria:

- **Completeness**: Coverage of key research areas
- **Specificity**: Concrete details vs generic statements  
- **Insight Quality**: Depth of analysis and actionable insights
- **Synthesis**: How well the decision agent combines research
- **Overall Performance**: System-wide scoring and recommendations

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   cd Agents
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure your API key**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```
   
   Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
   ```
   
   **Important**: Replace `sk-your-actual-api-key-here` with your actual OpenAI API key. Keep this file secure and never commit it to version control.

## Usage
